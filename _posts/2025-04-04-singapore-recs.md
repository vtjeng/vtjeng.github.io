_With ICLR 2025 coming up, many of my friends were asking about my travel recommendations for
Singapore, so I've decided to publish it here._

This guide is not meant to be a comprehensive "best of" list -- for that, there are travel sites
like [Conde Nast](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-things-to-do-in-singapore) (which, in my
opinion, has put together a great list!) or your friendly local language model. Instead, I've listed
things that I _personally_ like. Happy to answer questions!

## Food

Singapore has a range of world-class restaurants (e.g., see the
[Michelin Stars in Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Michelin-starred_restaurants_in_Singapore))
and many international options (e.g.,
[Japanese food](https://www.timeout.com/singapore/restaurants/the-best-japanese-restaurants-in-singapore)
is a popular option in Singapore), but I'll focus here on uniquely local experiences.

### Hawker Centres

Hawker centres are a Singaporean cultural institution that I can’t recommend more highly. Think a
mall food court, but with ~50-100 options for inexpensive and actually tasty food. (Remember the
[satay scene from Crazy Rich Asians?](https://www.eater.com/2018/9/4/17817658/crazy-rich-asians-singapore-night-market-scene-location)
That was shot at a hawker centre!).

- You don't have to go far from wherever you are to get good hawker food -- I'd recommend picking
  somewhere nearby and searching "`$HAWKER_centre_NAME` best stalls" to see what locals like (e.g.,
  see a list for [Maxwell Food centre](https://www.misstamchiak.com/maxwell-food-centre/) I found
  with that search).
- If you must have a list:
  - [Conde Nast](https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-hawker-centres-in-singapore) identifies
    some well-known hawker centres with a high concentration of great options.
  - The
    [Michelin Guide](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/singapore-region/singapore/restaurants/street-food)
    identifies specific stalls
  - Just remember that most stalls aren't on any best-of list but are still great!
- If you're struggling to figure out _what_ to eat: check out Leslie Tay's
  [Top Ten Hawker Dishes and Where to Eat Them](http://ieatishootipost.sg/singapores-top-ten-most-popular-hawker-dishes-and-where-to-eat-them/).
- _Stay away from..._: Newton Food Centre and Lau Pa Sat are two hawker centres that are far too
  touristy for my taste; Newton in particular is overrun with
  [queues and touts](https://www.timeout.com/singapore/restaurants/guide-to-newton-food-centre-tourist-trap-or-hawker-haven).

### Other Options

Perhaps you've been sold on local food but want air conditioning. Here are some options I've had and
liked, but this list is by no means comprehensive!

- [$] [Yakun](https://app.yakun.com/) or [Toast Box](https://toastbox.com.sg/):
  [kaya toast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_toast)
- [$] [Song Fa](https://songfa.com.sg/): [pork rib soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak_kut_teh)
- [$$] [The Coconut Club](https://www.thecoconutclub.sg/):
  [Nasi Lemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasi_lemak)
- [$$$] [Candlenut](https://www.comodempsey.sg/restaurant/candlenut): Peranakan food

## Sights

- [Singapore's Botanic Gardens](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/SBG) are a UNESCO World Heritage Site --
  think Central Park, but tropical. The
  [National Orchid Garden](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/our-gardens/tyersall-entrance/national-orchid-garden)
  contained within is worth a stop if you like flowers!
- Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam are really fun cultural districts with cool architecture
  and nice shopping streets.
- [Pulau Ubin](https://www.timeout.com/singapore/things-to-do/guide-to-pulau-ubin) is one of the
  last rural areas to be found in Singapore. It's popular with visitors from the mainland for
  recreational activities such as summer camps and outdoor activities.

## Staying Active

### Runs

- If you're around on Saturday and looking to be a bit competitive:
  [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.sg/) in Singapore boasts FOUR locations! (For the uninitiated:
  Parkrun is a fun and free 5k that’s held on Saturdays).
- For a short run from the downtown core: running around
  [Marina Bay](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m7SSvfjNbKmB4XL78) and the
  [Singapore River](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9c9ziRt6oJLhyMH58) is a lovely way to see the city.
  Depending on where you're staying, you can go up along the river and cross at one of the many
  bridges, or just do a loop around the bay.
  - See some
    [suggested routes between 3km - 10km](https://www.rqam.com.sg/events/best-evening-run-routes-around-marina-bay/).
  - When I run there, I make sure to go through
    [Gardens by the Bay](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ep9yyMwaZZMbYEED8) and the
    [Formula 1 Race Tracks](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3oXzpMzWrCqsNMfz5).
- If you're looking to go further:
  - [East Coast Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rSj6S1qGzDfVe15AA) is a lovely linear park (that you
    can take all the way to the airport). Stop at a hawker centre along the way or at the end!

### Hikes

Singapore's doesn't have the most stunning nature, but I find hiking through the city a fun way to
see it. Some recommendations

- The [Southern Ridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ridges) is a set of parks with unique
  views of Singapore's skyline.
- The [Rail Corridor](https://railcorridor.nparks.gov.sg/visit-rail-corridor/) brings you through
  many different parts of Singapore.
- The
  [TreeTop Walk](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/-/media/nparks-real-content/gardens-parks-and-nature/diy-walk/diy-walk-pdf-files/treetop_walk_eguide_lres.pdf)
  gives a bird's eye view of the forest, rising above the canopy of the tropical forest.
- If that's still not enough: see the ["Park Connectors"](https://pcn.nparks.gov.sg/), an
  island-wide route of trails and footpaths.

## Logistics

### Connectivity

I used to recommend a local SIM card but an eSIM (e.g., from MobiMatter) has worked great for me and
is far more convenient if your phone supports it. Comparison shop at [eSIMDB](https://esimdb.com/).

### Payments

You'll be able to pay with your card almost anywhere; and cash is now only really necessary at
places like hawker centres (you could even try e-payments there if you're willing to set it up ...).
I still recommend cash for convenience; if you know me personally I'm happy to exchange excess
Singapore dollars for US dollars.

### Getting Around

- **Public transit** (including buses and the subway - a.k.a. "MRT") takes contactless payments.
  Remember to tap out on the bus – otherwise it'll assume that you rode the bus all the way to the
  end, and charge accordingly! (To be fair: even the maximum fare is relatively inexpensive by the
  standards of American public transit). You'll see the bill for all your public transit use
  consolidated at the end of the day.
- **Cars**:
  - There are a bunch of rideshare options. I've tried Gojek, Grab, TADA, and Zig; I comparison-shop
    but you'd probably be fine.
  - You can hail a taxi on the street, but I haven't done that in ages because rideshare is just so
    convenient.

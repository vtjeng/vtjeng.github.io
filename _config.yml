theme: minima
## Version of minima in use.
# Note: It would be nice if we could use the new version of minima, but deployment via GitHub pages forces us to use 2.5.1. https://github.com/jekyll/minima/issues/411 tracks the next release.
## KaTeX
# KaTeX is a good option that is generally faster: https://gendignoux.com/blog/2020/05/23/katex.html
# However, adding it on GitHub pages is complex: https://karas.io/blog/math-support-with-katex-on-github-pages/, https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/2262
# One of the issues is that the github-pages gem overrides the kramdown math engine. (See https://github.com/github/pages-gem/pull/545 for more.)
